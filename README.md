# software_engineering_csc510_project

We compared three open source projects namely SuiteCRM, vTiger and DjangoCRM.

Our goal was to find out which is the best product in terms of:
  1) software developers who want to contribute to a project
  2) project managers who are looking to use one of these projects
  
We used the following points to compare these projects:
  1) Installation (external dependencies, usage of dependency managers, time and difficulty level of installing the project)
  2) Usage (time to resolve issues, and build time)
  3) Community Support (the topics, languages and the number of users in the community)
  4) Popularity of the project on github(number of commits, forks, pull requests and contributors)
  5) Technical debt (line of comments in the code, code smells)
  6) GUI (how intuitive and pleasant was the GUI)
  
Result:
  1) DjangoCRM is good for developers who are looking to contribute to a project
  2) SuiteCRM is good for project managers who want a open source, free solution.
  3) vTiger is good for project managers can buy enterprise or professional editions of the software.
  
Contents of this project:
  1) Report for the detailed explanation of how we conducted our analysis and reached our conclusions
  2) folders of data that we collected from tool outputs on each of these projects
  3) some scripts we wrote to extract data from the github api.

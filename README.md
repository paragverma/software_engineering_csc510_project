# software_engineering_csc510_project

We compared three open source projects namely SuiteCRM, vTiger and DjangoCRM.

Our goal was to find out which is the best product in terms of:
  1) software developers who want to contribute to a project
  2) project managers who are looking to use one of these projects
  
We used the following points to compare these projects:
  1) Installation (external dependencies, usage of dependency managers, time and difficulty level of installing the project)
  2) Usage (time to resolve issues, and build time)
  3) Community Support (the topics, languages and the number of users in the community)
  4) Popularity of the project on github(number of commits, forks, pull requests and contributors)
  5) Technical debt (line of comments in the code, code smells)
